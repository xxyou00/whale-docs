# 18A. Q: What is the difference between setting trading limits per currency and setting them for all currencies?

A: When configuring per-currency limits, you must select the corresponding currency and restrict use to the corresponding market. Configuring an all-currency limit applies the trading limit across different markets; if an all-currency limit is set, per-currency trading limits cannot be configured.

# 18B. Q: If both global limits and client limits exist, how are they evaluated?

A: Limit precedence is: client limits &gt; global limits; security limits &gt; global limits; trader limits &gt; global limits.

<p>For example: the global configuration sets the &quot;Customer buy-rejection limit&quot; to &gt; 500,000 HKD. User A has configured a &quot;Customer buy-rejection limit&quot; of &gt; 400,000 HKD (reject).If User A places a buy order for 410,000, the configured limit is hit and the order will be rejected outright. If User B places a buy order for 410,000, the global configuration is evaluated; since the global limit is not breached, the order will be allowed.</p>
