Answer: Configure this in WBO under Business Parameter Settings &gt; Market Management.

(iv) Finally, in the calendar select the market’s closed days and mark them as holidays.

Additionally, if the Hong Kong and A-share markets are both closed on the same day, you may mark other markets as closed as well to avoid unnecessary empty end-of-day runs.

Half-day trading sessions in different markets can be designated as settlement days or non-settlement days; please configure the appropriate type in the market calendar.

# 5.1B Question: How do I perform a clearing reversal?

Answer: On the  Day-End Settlement &gt; Clearing Cancellation , click " New Clearing Cancellation " (See Figure 5.1B-1)

Select the financial date, post-send settlement handling, asset-class rollback, and market(s) (multiple markets can be selected), then click "Submit for Approval." (See Figure 5.1B-2)

- "Accounting Reversal" performs a comprehensive reversal of fees, such as charged commissions, interest deductions, and clearing accounting calculations. It does not affect deposits/withdrawals, trade orders, or account-opening data.
- Clearing financial dates cannot be skipped. For example, if today is 2024-01-26 and you need to reverse to 2024-01-24, first reverse 2024-01-26, complete that, then reverse 2024-01-25, and finally reverse 2024-01-24; otherwise, the clearing process will report an error.

If it is not necessary to recalculate interest/settlement data, asset-class rollback may be left unselected.

# 5.1C Question: Why does ZunJia’s position file not need to be imported by market?

Answer: ZunJia’s position file does not separate Hong Kong and U.S. markets; positions are consolidated into a single file for provision, so the import system does not need to distinguish markets.
