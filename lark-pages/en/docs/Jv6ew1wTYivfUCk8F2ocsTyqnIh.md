</div>

The Hong Kong IPO subscription workflow enables brokers to manage the full lifecycle of clients’ Hong Kong IPO subscriptions, including new-issue information management, subscription configuration, subscription orders, and allotment allocation. This is the core workflow of the IPO system.

### 1.1.1 New-Issue List

The New-Issue List page manages all historical Hong Kong new-issue entries and differentiates them into three statuses to facilitate broker operations:

- Subscription Not Open: new-issue information exists but the broker has not yet opened subscriptions before listing.
- Subscription In Progress: the broker has opened subscriptions, but the issue has not yet listed and subsequent steps remain.
- All: includes all new issues, including those already listed or withdrawn.

When a new-issue announcement is available, the system automatically synchronizes data from market feeds and records it by default in the "Subscription Not Open" list for brokers to review and configure. For issues with subscriptions not yet opened, click "Details" to configure the new issue.

Operation Button Descriptions

- Details: view detailed information and order data for the new issue.
- Charge (Debit): this button appears only when there are orders pending debit; click to perform a quick debit operation.
- Publish Allotment: this button appears only when there are orders that require allotment publication; click to perform the allotment operation.

### 1.1.2 Subscription Information Configuration

If a broker intends to open client subscriptions for a given IPO, they must manually enable subscription and complete basic settings, including configuring subscription method, subscription time window, and eligible client groups.

1.1.2.1 Cash Subscription

1. Click "Details" from the New-Issue List to enter the configuration page; by default the issue is “Not Subscribable.”
2. Select "Yes" and save to enable subscription; once enabled, cash subscription is the default and only option.
3. After saving, cash subscription is enabled.

<img src="/assets/ZCl4buzxRo6mooxjxZhjQ8Crpwb.png" src-width="3182" src-height="2048" align="center"/>

1.1.2.2 Financing Subscription Configuration

If a broker needs to enable "Financing Subscription" for an issue, a financing pool must be configured. If not enabling financing subscription, this configuration is not required.

Step 1: Create a Financing Pool

- Basic Information

Click "Create" at the top-right of "Financing Subscription" to configure the financing pool; a settings dialog will appear.

<img src="/assets/KkxjbDFtJod9tCxD6BAj2pJfpJg.png" src-width="3182" src-height="2058" align="center"/>

After completing the basic data, click "Submit for Approval" if no further configuration is required.

<img src="/assets/RsqwbBkZmoEiZ0xvKYgjfSYzpug.png" src-width="3192" src-height="2066" align="center"/>

- More Configuration

Click "More Configuration" to perform customized settings.

Tips:

1. Data in "More Configuration" is typically for special controls and is optional.
2. Visible client group: defaults to all clients; if the broker uses a user-segmentation feature in the operations system, the financing pool can be made available only to specific client segments.
3. Upper and lower share limits control the allowable subscription share range per client.

<img src="/assets/PBlHbAKFOo9JR3xGHsijYtn7p7g.png" src-width="3192" src-height="2058" align="center"/>

- Client Segmentation Configuration

The financing pool can include multiple segmentation rules to meet operational requirements, for example:

1. Client group A may subscribe up to 10,000 shares;
2. Client group B may subscribe up to 100,000 shares.

<img src="/assets/JLGSb2SSWotCi1xnu21jUygJpaf.png" src-width="3308" src-height="2152" align="center"/>

Step 2: Financing Pool Approval

After submission, the financing pool defaults to "Pending Approval" and only becomes effective after approval.

Tips:

There are two approval entry points for financing pools:

1. Financing Pool List
2. Financing Pool Approval Page

<img src="/assets/GLtrbu6LcoAE4rxgppQjFHlBpCd.png" src-width="2126" src-height="518" align="center"/>

<img src="/assets/FuZfbovfGooNMex4ndPj2Avqpm3.png" src-width="3178" src-height="2056" align="center"/>

Click "Review" to view the work order details; once approved, the financing pool becomes active.

<img src="/assets/Bq1jbx5g5oSsdPxR8Z6jjzsppUg.png" src-width="3194" src-height="2072" align="center"/>

1.1.2.3 Zero-Principal Subscription Configuration

If a broker needs to enable "Zero-Principal Subscription," a financing pool for zero-principal subscriptions must be created. If not enabling, this configuration is not required.

Zero-principal subscription is a special subscription method where the financing ratio provided to clients is fixed at 100%; clients can subscribe to the IPO without any principal.

Step 1: Create a Financing Pool

- Basic Information

Click "Create" at the top-right of "Zero-Principal Subscription" to configure the corresponding financing pool; a settings dialog will appear.

<img src="/assets/XBMHbGeSQo9erUxz7ycjhUXVplJ.png" src-width="3172" src-height="2056" align="center"/>

After entering the basic data, click "Submit for Approval" if no further settings are necessary.

Tips:

This configuration is similar to the financing subscription settings, except there is no financing ratio to select; it is fixed at 100%. For more details, refer to the Financing Subscription settings.

<img src="/assets/XPz3bJpDMosGRDxTgeijECOeplg.png" src-width="3192" src-height="2066" align="center"/>

### 1.1.3 App Display Information

This page is used to configure App display "Tags" and "Display Copy."

- Tags: no default data; tags must be added manually.
- Display Copy: a default display copy is generated for each new-issue entry; editing is optional. If modification is needed, it can be edited on this page.

<img src="/assets/ALQMbcrcmoeP5GxRod9jDRrFpMh.png" src-width="3182" src-height="2066" align="center"/>

### 1.1.4 Subscription Records

This page displays all subscription records for the corresponding IPO, including revoked or manually rejected orders; "Debit" and "Allotment" operations can be performed from this page.

<img src="/assets/KHM5bcWOHoeKQlxnv1YjBuZIply.png" src-width="3176" src-height="2048" align="center"/>

1.1.4.1 Debit Operation

After the IPO subscription deadline, the broker must submit confirmed IPO order data to HKEX or another placement party. At this stage, the broker performs debit operations on valid subscription orders to collect the subscription amount and subscription fee and disburses the corresponding financing amount.

There are two entry points for debit operations:

1. Subscription In Progress list page: displays quick action entry points dynamically based on order status.
2. IPO Details – Subscription Records page: displays quick action entry points dynamically based on order status.

Step 1: Click Debit and Confirm Order Scope

After clicking Debit, the system displays the scope of orders pending debit; confirm and select the order range, then proceed to the next step.

<img src="/assets/J1WwbO74RoE7VaxpvuujAIPBplh.png" src-width="3184" src-height="2066" align="center"/>

Step 2: Verify Debit Order Details

The system automatically calculates preview data based on subscription orders, fees, financing ratios, etc. The operator must verify the relevant data and submit for review.

<img src="/assets/P0iQbhLXfokMjrxCuOFjugWUpKd.png" src-width="3184" src-height="2064" align="center"/>

Step 3: Debit Approval

There are two entry points for debit approval:

1. A dedicated debit approval page: view historical debit requests and approval records.
2. Work order records: users with approval permissions can directly review in the Pending Work Orders list.

Click "Review" to view the work order; approval completes the process.

<img src="/assets/GYRGbG7AuoDc7wxXdehjw6ZVpOg.png" src-width="3192" src-height="2060" align="center"/>

<img src="/assets/Q4FHbtYKSod7luxl08ejehLjpHb.png" src-width="3196" src-height="2082" align="center"/>

1.1.4.2 Publish Allotment

Allotment results are typically published one trading day before listing. The system must process allotment results for clients and ensure allotted shares are credited on the same day.

For clients who receive allotments: the subscription amount is refunded, the IPO financing provided is recovered, IPO financing interest is deducted, and allotment payment and allotment fees are additionally deducted; the allotted shares are then delivered.

For clients who do not receive allotments: the subscription amount is refunded, the IPO financing provided is recovered, and IPO financing interest is deducted.

Allotment operations have two entry points:

1. Subscription In Progress list page: displays quick action entry points dynamically based on order status.
2. IPO Details – Subscription Records page: displays quick action entry points dynamically based on order status.

Step 1: Click Publish Allotment and Verify Data

After clicking Publish Allotment, the broker must confirm the following data; if correct, click "Next."

1. IPO Price: the system normally retrieves this automatically; the broker confirms. If automatic retrieval is abnormal, the operator may input the price manually.
2. Client interest-bearing days: default is the difference between Allotment Date and Subscription Deadline (consistent with HKEX time); the operator may modify.

<img src="/assets/UQZub58jSo4cVGxhJAdjcFAppvd.png" src-width="3196" src-height="2080" align="center"/>

Step 2: Select Allotment Method

The IPO system provides multiple allotment methods; brokers may select according to actual conditions.

Uploading a Custom CSV File

1. Download the sample template, which includes:
    1. Order: the IPO system order number
    2. APPLY: the number of shares applied by the client for that order
    3. SUCCESS: the number of shares allotted to the client

<img src="/assets/C3wob3W8DocJUxxJmhDjm2owpqg.png" src-width="1004" src-height="258" align="center"/>

1. Fill in allotment data and upload the file.

<img src="/assets/RAxFbPhixo6oHexaGyij7m4Dprf.png" src-width="3206" src-height="2060" align="center"/>

Step 3: Verify Allotment Results

The system parses the allotment file according to the selected allotment method and generated summary and detail data.

Summary data: used to reconcile total quantities and total allotted shares with the placement party, enabling quick detection of quantity discrepancies.

Detail data: used to preview allotment and deduction details.

If data is correct, click "Confirm" to submit for review.

<img src="/assets/THIabUoelohz3gxHXpGjcpN0p2c.png" src-width="3190" src-height="2074" align="center"/>

Step 4: Allotment Result Review

Allotment approvals have two entry points:

1. Dedicated allotment approval page: view historical allotment applications and approval records.
2. Work order records: users with approval permissions can operate in the Pending Work Orders list.

Click "Review" to view the work order; approval completes the process.

<img src="/assets/UEnubeERVoWHQMx05v1jFAznpBg.png" src-width="3188" src-height="2056" align="center"/>

<img src="/assets/JScvbkwhqoMgpnx7m63jVTYHpFc.png" src-width="3190" src-height="1966" align="center"/>

### 1.1.5 File Generation

For IPO subscription orders with confirmed successful debits, brokers must submit orders to the placement party or HKEX. Typically, IPOs submitted through HKEX require CCASS files, while IPOs placed through other parties typically require offline Excel or CSV file transfers.

1.1.5.1 FINI Configured

If the broker is configured to use the FINI platform, the Whale system will directly synchronize IPO orders to HKEX via API; no manual file generation is required.

1.1.5.2 FINI Not Configured

Step 1: Select Order Type

Select the order type according to channel or financing ratio, and click "Generate File."

It is recommended to generate a single file for orders placed through the same placement party.

Examples:

1. Financing provided through a specific bank and not directly via HKEX: generate a CSV file for that channel.
2. Cash and zero-principal subscriptions processed via HKEX: generate a CCASS file together.

<img src="/assets/V61Ab8HRCoqRxax53Iljhz24pBd.png" src-width="3182" src-height="2052" align="center"/>

Step 2: Generate Specified File

In the side panel dialog, select the desired file format and specify a filename; click "Generate and Download."

<div class='callout-emoji'>🎁</div>
<p>⚓ Business Parameter Configuration &gt; New-Issue Configuration &gt; Fee Management</p>
</div>

IPO fees are configured as fee packages (billing plans) that may be reused across multiple new issues. When configuring new-issue subscription information, select a preset fee package. Billing items primarily include:

Prior to system launch, allotment fee defaults will be set according to HKEX requirements. Brokers can click "Default Allotment Fee" in the top-right to modify or set these values.

- Use recognizable names for fee plans, e.g., "90% Financing Rate" or "Cash Fee Plan."
- For zero-principal subscription scenarios, if no allotment fee is to be charged, set the allotment fee to 0 in the plan.

Tip: Allotment fees are charged by the exchange and typically do not change. Set default values once; these are referenced by billing packages and need not be entered each time.

### 3.1.2 Operational Steps

Step 1: Set Default Allotment Fee

Click "Default Allotment Fee" in the top-right, enter the corresponding information, and confirm.

<img src="/assets/MWlmb0IJdoEfTUxcb9nj5QzBpnh.png" src-width="3782" src-height="2350" align="center"/>

Step 2: Create Fee Package

Click "Create" in the top-right to configure a billing plan; complete the fields and confirm.

Channel configuration manages the financing sources for client IPO subscriptions:

1. The source of IPO funds: e.g., broker-owned funds or financing provided by a bank;
2. The types of subscription this channel supports: e.g., cash subscription only or zero-principal subscription only.

Assigning different channels facilitates subsequent financing cost management and IPO data reporting.

This feature controls whether holdings-based purchasing power may be used for IPO subscriptions. If not configured, holdings-based purchasing power is not supported by default.

- If holdings-based purchasing power is supported: the cash portion of subscriptions (for both cash and financing subscriptions) may be covered by pledged holdings’ purchasing power.
    - Example: cash balance is 0; holdings worth 100,000 HKD can provide 60,000 HKD purchasing power. A client may use 60,000 HKD of purchasing power for a cash subscription without having actual cash.

- If not supported: the cash portion must be paid with settled HKD cash only.
    - Example: cash balance is 0; holdings worth 100,000 HKD can provide 60,000 HKD purchasing power. If holdings-based purchasing power is not supported, cash subscription amount is 0 and financing subscriptions with a cash portion cannot proceed.

### 3.2.2 Operational Steps

Purchasing Power Uplift Coefficient Explanation:

This coefficient indicates that holdings cannot be fully pledged when subscribing. For example, for stock 700.HK, holdings worth 10,000 HKD with initial margin = 40% means purchasable power is 6,000 HKD. If an uplift coefficient of 0.2 is entered, the initial margin for IPO subscription will be 40% + 20% = 60% (capped at 100%), and purchasing power for subscription becomes 10,000 × (1 − 60%) = 4,000 HKD.
