# 12.0.2 Trade Reports (TDR Category)

# 12.0.2A Q: Why does the market order price in the TDR001-1 Daily Client Order Report By Client differ so significantly from the stock's current price?

<b>A:</b> Market orders are not exchange orders; they are submitted as Special Limit Orders (SLO) at the counterparty's price band. Because the execution price is uncertain and to prevent account overdrafts, a protective fund freeze of 20% (1.2×) is applied.

# 12.0.2B Q: Why do the "Execution Time" and "Trade Date" filter times not match for U.S. equities in the TDR005 - Trade Summary Report?

A: This is due to time zone differences. U.S. equities include overnight trading sessions. The report displays execution times in Hong Kong Time and reflects trading records from the U.S. market.
