# Client Information Component

1. Open the "Client Information" component; you must enter the Securities Account before performing a search. The component supports viewing assets, holdings, orders, transaction flows, and other data.

1. Client Information Component Horizontal / Vertical Layout Switch
    - The Client Information component supports switching between horizontal and vertical layouts; you can quickly switch via the "···" in the upper right corner.
        - The vertical layout presents asset information more compactly; the right side also adds a comparison of two states of today's orders (In Progress, Executed), allowing a more intuitive single-view of the client's assets, holdings, and orders. Functionality is more centralized and usage is smoother.
        - After switching to the vertical layout, subsequently opened Client Information components will retain that layout.
        - The vertical layout occupies relatively more space; it is recommended to open it in a new tab. Switching to it within the trading panel may result in incomplete information display.

            - A new setting item has been added to control whether newly opened Client Information components follow the custom settings below; if not followed, newly opened components will open in the default layout.
            - Show/Hide Settings: unlike the horizontal layout, in the vertical layout setting a Tab to hidden means it is collapsed into a dropdown rather than being not displayed (the horizontal layout retains the existing show/hide logic).
