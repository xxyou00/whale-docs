# 17F Question: If the front-end market view is set to 40 broker levels for bids and asks, how is the "40 levels" calculated?

Answer: The broker bid/ask depth contains a list of the top 40 broker IDs in the buy/sell direction:

- If more than 40 brokers are present at a single price level, the page displays the first 40 brokers.
- If fewer than 40 brokers are present at a single price level, then:
40 = Number of Brokers + Number of Price Levels with Brokers + Number of Price Levels without Brokers * 2.

<p>Note: Under exchange rules, a price level with no brokers occupies two rows: one row indicates the distance from the reference price, and the other row indicates that there are no brokers at that price.</p>
