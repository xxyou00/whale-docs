# System Overview

# System Introduction

# Overview

Risk control management is primarily used to handle functions related to margin configuration, limit management, and Margin Call within securities business. The main modules involved are as follows:

# Business Operations Management

# Credit Limits

The system currently provides two types of limits: financing limits and trading limits. Trading limits are granted to well‑cooperating institutional clients or cash accounts and may be used to trade when buying power is insufficient. Financing limits apply to margin accounts and are granted to users after a comprehensive assessment of the client's asset information; clients may utilize funds within the granted limit.

## Financing Limit

About automatic credit granting:

If a client opens a margin account and subsequently performs a transfer of positions or a deposit, the system will automatically grant the client a certain credit limit to enable margin trading. The system supports an automatic credit mechanism (transfer settlement / deposit settlement). The consolidated automatic credit flow is as follows:

### Credit Limit

Menu description: This menu is mainly used to query the credit limits of all credited clients; it also supports manually granting or adjusting credit limits upon client request.

Primary operation scenarios are as follows:

Adjusting client limits

1. The list displays all financing credit clients. Opening the adjustment modal from the list page allows adjustment of limits for already credited clients.

<img src="/assets/AXPbbMNfBoL6QgxHLeTjFGaSpdd.png" src-width="2486" src-height="1362" align="center"/>

Adjustment page

- Field descriptions:

1. Confirm the "Adjusted Limit". Submission will create a corresponding record on the limit approval page for approval; see "Limit Approval ".

Creating a new credited client

1. If a client has no assets credited, an uncredited client may be granted a limit individually via the list page's "Create Credited Client" action.

<img src="/assets/JUWobtnMCoVNpsx0kn7jcBgEpIf.png" src-width="2488" src-height="1392" align="center"/>

1. Complete the required fields in the modal (if the client already exists in the credit list, the system will prompt during submission; client limits can be viewed in the main list).

<img src="/assets/VXMgbTxMHotlvTxx9ErjEiEnpac.png" src-width="2490" src-height="1394" align="center"/>

1. To grant credit to multiple clients at once, use the "Bulk New" operation at the top right of the list.

<img src="/assets/OHvub45v3oip78xvIRujIIgWpdf.png" src-width="2598" src-height="1466" align="center"/>

1. Whether added individually or in bulk, submissions must be approved in the work order system. Only after approval can the client limits take effect.

Deleting credit limits for closed accounts

There may be cases where some client accounts have been closed but still count toward the company's total approved limit; such client limits can be manually deleted.

1. Filter credited clients by closed status.

<img src="/assets/P7KGbVmG3o1Y6PxSfGpjp72tpXg.png" src-width="3244" src-height="1392" align="center"/>

1. Select and delete credited clients whose accounts have been closed.

<img src="/assets/Ag4dbz11HoAL1IxGoeSjfEu3p2b.png" src-width="3170" src-height="730" align="center"/>

Setting company limits

1. Based on the consolidated client limits, if it is necessary to synchronously adjust company limits for overall control, access "Set Company Limits" from the top area of the page list to perform the operation.

<img src="/assets/ChuObUWcoowLcqxgIWLjVmBFpjf.png" src-width="2444" src-height="1374" align="center"/>

1. Company limit settings: When a tenant goes live, the system initializes default limits. Tenants may later customize these limits according to business requirements; modify each dimension via the page "Edit" operation. Changes must be approved through the work order process to take effect.

<img src="/assets/TfBlb57rRoBEMLxgIGqjDof0pGf.png" src-width="2468" src-height="1356" align="center"/>

- Field descriptions

1. After confirming the information, submit for approval. The approval will be processed in the work order system; only upon completion of that approval will the limit adjustment take effect.

Tips:

Work order approval flows can be configured based on limit ranges. The corresponding approval flow work order identifier is `credit.credit_adjust`.

### Client FPS

Menu description: This menu is used to query clients' FPS values for margin financing credit (the initial FPS configuration can be viewed under "Business Parameter Settings" - "Risk Control" - "Credit Client Parameters") and to configure custom FPS rules (you may adjust the global FPS baseline by adding or subtracting values across defined dimensions).

Configuring FPS rules

1. Click "Rule Configuration" on the page to open the rules page.

<img src="/assets/EALsbK42Bo1RiAx1zwKjC9zMpkh.png" src-width="2470" src-height="572" align="center"/>

### Credit Groups

Menu description: This menu is used to set up credit groups and manage group limits. Usage within a group must not exceed the group's limit. This feature is useful for grouping multiple accounts belonging to the same client (or related accounts such as spouses) under a shared group limit.

Main list page description

The list page allows viewing all credit groups and the total approved credit; each group's usage is also displayed. As follows:

1. Total financing limit : the sum of all group limits for existing credit groups.
2. Credit group details: supports editing group information and adding new accounts to the group; the group limit and usage are displayed, and if usage exceeds the group limit, the progress bar will show a red alert.
3. Group account details: displays each group account's financing limit and usage; supports adjusting account limits within the group and removing accounts from the group.

<img src="/assets/KIFSbzS5io8PScxdp1Sj84X0pbd.png" src-width="2470" src-height="644" align="center"/>

## Debit Notification

Brokerage client accounts commonly use an aggregated buying power conversion mechanism to facilitate trading in non‑local currencies (for example, using HKD to trade USD‑denominated stocks). After a client executes such trades, the client's account may involve a currency borrowing position (the brokerage temporarily provides foreign currency to a foreign broker for trading). Subsequently the client needs to perform currency exchange operations. Therefore, preconfigured currency borrowing/exchange reminders can be incorporated into risk control management to notify clients to complete exchange tasks.

Business flow:

<img src="/assets/Qr2ibvLcwo4uD4xRjJsjAYudpje.png" src-width="1024" src-height="222" align="center"/>

### Client Notification

Menu description: This menu can query all clients requiring reminders, supports configuration of borrowing reminder rules, and supports manual currency exchanges.

Operation flow:

1. Click "Conversion Rule" at the top right of the list to configure borrowing reminder rules.

<img src="/assets/HO41bBMczocFNbxbWwHjEDIkpQc.png" src-width="2474" src-height="1128" align="center"/>

1. Conversion Rule: Single‑currency rules are optional; other fields are mandatory. Rules only execute when enabled.
    1. Mandatory fields for outstanding amounts and other currencies' withdrawable amounts default to the base currency; all currencies are converted to the base currency for calculation.
    2. A reminder triggers if either the single‑currency rule or the mandatory field rule is satisfied.
    3. Single‑currency rules may set different rules per currency; add and remove as needed.

<img src="/assets/NE1ibl7hjoQhznxpvHIj0iTJpQb.png" src-width="2484" src-height="1372" align="center"/>

1. After configuring rules, enable and submit for work order review. Once approved, the system will execute the rule, retrieve clients matching the rule, and display results in the "Reminder Query" list. Additionally, the rule executes regularly on trading days and sends currency borrowing reminder messages to matching clients to prompt proactive exchanges. The page action "Fetch Exchange Users" refreshes the list and filters out clients that no longer meet the rule.

<img src="/assets/KrgRbiNEDoD2lvxnv8PjQRY4pCg.png" src-width="2450" src-height="1012" align="center"/>

1. After enabling the rule, clients can also view an "Auto Repayment" function in the mobile app and opt in. If a client enables Auto Repayment and triggers the rule, the system will perform automatic exchanges or background manual conversion operations as configured.

    <img src="/assets/Xz9nbTKh3oQjdYxxT7kjIIknpsc.png" src-width="710" src-height="1572" align="center"/>
    
App navigation: "Me" - "Settings" - "Account Preference"
If "Auto-currency Conversion" is enabled in the App, the "Auto Convert" field displays as "Open" and supports the "Exchange" operation.
    <img src="/assets/C4PXbnEPDocRZkxOMfejcQ6EpHf.png" src-width="2472" src-height="870" align="center"/>
    1. App "Auto Repayment"

2. Exchange: Clients who enable Auto Repayment default to automatic system exchange; before the system executes automatic exchange, the page also supports manual exchange. The list "Details" action allows viewing real‑time client data, message history, and exchange records. The manual exchange modal shows the client's current cash situation and allows configuration of exchange amounts and currencies to confirm the exchange.

<img src="/assets/FngsbPiBwormMpxxdRMjNlAApcf.png" src-width="2502" src-height="1164" align="center"/>

<img src="/assets/EKIFbczVFo3zdGx4f0JjI1MVp5d.png" src-width="2498" src-height="1202" align="center"/>

1. Exchange result review: After manual/automatic exchange completes, if remaining assets still meet the rule conditions they will remain in the Reminder Query list; if they no longer meet the conditions they move to history, viewable under "History (link missing)". For exchange audit triggers or exchange failures, view exceptions on the "Exchange Exceptions" page (exchange audits require manual review under "Funds Management" - "Exchange" - "Client Exchange").

<img src="/assets/OcknbnmQWoBlXcxqU86jd3APpPg.png" src-width="2478" src-height="1020" align="center"/>

# Margin Call

When a client's net asset value falls below the maintenance margin level due to market fluctuations, the system will issue a Margin Call notice. The client must replenish funds or close positions within three trading days; otherwise the business has the right to liquidate positions on the client's behalf without prior notice.

### Snapshots

Menu description: When a client triggers a margin call, it is necessary to retain the historical data snapshot at the moment of trigger for traceability; such snapshots can serve as reference for operations (RO) or compliance reviews and as evidence for regulatory reporting. Therefore, margin call history requires snapshot data in certain scenarios.

Scenarios include: triggering a margin call / triggering a force call / triggering notification / daily scheduled record / ending a margin call.

Sellable status description: There are three statuses:
    - Sellable: sufficient securities lending inventory; the stock supports short selling.
    - Prohibited: manually set to prohibit short selling; the stock does not support securities lending.
    - System Auto‑prohibited: if a manual securities lending inventory threshold rule is set, when inventory meets the automatic closure rule the system will automatically prohibit short selling. From the client's perspective the stock supports securities lending but inventory is insufficient to execute short selling. If automatic recovery conditions are met, the system will restore "Sellable."

<img src="/assets/PBjZbU9y9ox3oBx1v5wjTFKtpEg.png" src-width="2298" src-height="1280" align="center"/>

Tips:

For securities lending inventory rules: the automatic recovery threshold must be greater than or equal to the automatic closure threshold.

LC data

1. Second part: Liquid capital shortfall

This data simulates shortfall results when collateral declines by x and compares whether a buffer remains.

Buffer = 50% of liquid capital surplus - liquid capital shortfall

<img src="/assets/VhwcbfHe1oBiymxf3Wsjuwtrpie.png" src-width="3306" src-height="1800" align="center"/>

Liquid capital shortfall

Stock decline x is a variable determined according to margin guideline rules, detailed as follows:

Calculate by market value and classify holdings by level to compute proportion; based on the composition of collateral securities, apply appropriate hypothetical stress tests. Calculations can be performed once after market close each trading day.

(a) If level‑1 collateral proportion exceeds 75% (by market value), the average price decline equals parameter a.

(b) If the combined proportion of level‑1 and level‑2 collateral exceeds 75% (by market value), the average price decline equals parameter b.

(c) If the combined proportion of level‑1 and level‑2 collateral is between 25% and 75% (by market value), the average price decline equals parameter c.

(d) If the combined proportion of level‑1 and level‑2 collateral is below 25% (by market value), the average price decline equals parameter d.

1. Third part: Liquid capital shortfall

This section simulates each collateral becoming non‑pledgeable and the impact on shortfall; it ranks the top 10 stocks by the magnitude of shortfall impact.
